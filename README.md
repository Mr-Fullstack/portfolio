the first project is a bit old, in fact it is a recreation of a website originally designed by the CEO and Instructor of Origamid who made this layout available only for viewing on the online tool Figma, then I became interested in the design of the website and wanted to do it myself , this time I was learning bootstrap despite not being adept at using it.
